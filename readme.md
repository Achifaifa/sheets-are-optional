# Sheets Are Optional

**Sheets Are Optional** (SAO) is a minimalist TTRPG system focused on narrative, roleplay, improvisation and fun. It prioritizes fast character creation and hassle-free combat over detailed simulations and faithfulness to more traditional systems, and is intended for groups that want an option for unexpected meetings in which they may not have the time to set up a new game in a traditional system.

This repository contains the source latex files for the manual and the inkscape files for the printable character sheets. PDFs are available on itch.io on a 'pay what you want' basis.
