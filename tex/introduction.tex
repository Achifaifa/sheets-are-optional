It was Easter 2018 when, at a small tabletop gaming event called Omicron, we decided to play a quick, fun and improvised game of D\&D. After grabbing the rulebook we realised that D\&D had way too many rules, and that character creation took way, way longer than any of us remembered. 
\par 
After ignoring half the rulebook and making up the other half in what became a memorably good session, I decided to consolidate everything we had made up to prepare for a possible future game. Over time, the lore of the utterly nonsensical universe evolved, together with the system we ended up adopting for most of our on-the-spot, improvised TTRPG sessions
\par
This document contains the system as it exists now. It's designed for games focused on narrative, roleplaying, bad puns, and as much nonsense as the group can handle (Usually a tad more), with minimal prep time and resources needed.
\par 
This system uses D20 die for the few situations where dice rolls are necessary, which can be skipped altogether (See 'variants' for a diceless version)
\par
I hope this system brings you and your group as much joy, laughter and memorable moments as it did to ours.
